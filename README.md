<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

This project is born with love to old games like [Zork](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) and an idea in mind: being able to desing a text-based adventure changing only a few elements in the project. That way, game designers can implement an adventure without modify the code. 
This project follows, or try to, the next points:
* Adventure without worry about the size. The designer must be able to enter all the rooms they want without worry.
* Clean code. The code must be readable.
* Fun! What's the point of designing a videogame if you aren't having fun?

<!-- BUILT WITH -->

<!-- DESIGNINFO -->

## Documentation for designers

*This section might change in the future, take the instructions with a pint of salt*

Let's get down to business, we've come here to design a videogame.

### World

First things first, here we have a World which include all the elements present in the game. Inside the World there are the next elements:

*  **Rooms**: Each Room in the game, inside each room there are items.
* **Doors**: Doors who may or not block the path to exit the Room.
* **Non Interactable Items**: Items which have no use except a message if the player use them.
* **Keys**: The Item which open Doors or Chests if the player use them with the Door or Chest.
* **Chests**: Items which contains more items.
* **Interactable Items**: Items which open Doors or Chests if the player use them alone.
* **Endgame Tale**: Text which will be displayed if the player completes the game.

This elements are inside a XML document, each one inside their own list. You can put the elements inside their respective list. For example:

```xml
<EndGameStoryList>
  <string>Tras mucho esfuerzo, llegas al final.</string>
  <string>Tus esfuerzos han sido recompensados.</string>
</EndGameStoryList>
```

**Important**: Each element inside of the world must have their own unique id. There are two groups which their members can repeat ids: Rooms and Items. This means, one item can have the same id that a room but one door can't have the same id that a chest.

We are going to visit every one of them in the next points.

### Rooms

Each Room in the game must be represented in an object. A Room has the following attributes:

* **id**: Id who identifies the room. Must be unique and can't be repeated. 
* **name**: The name of the room.
* **description**: Description of the room, this would appear each time the player enters.
* **story**: The story of the game. What happens when the player enters the room for the first time. It's separated in pages.
* **directions**: The directions which the player can follow to exit the room. There are 10 possible directions: north, norteast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up and down. By default is -1. You must put the id of the room in that direction so the player can go there.
* **doors**: Marks the path who have a door. By default is -1. You must put the id of the door in that direction.
* **items**: Items present in that room. A room is empty by default, if you want to put an item in there you must put the id in the list.
* **doors**: Doors in the room.  A room doens't have any door by default, if you want to put an door there you must put the id in the list.
* **endgame**: This marks if that room is the final room so when the player gets there the game ends. False by default.
* **visited**: This marks if the room has been visited. False by default.

This is an example of a XML of a Room:

```xml
<room>
    <id>0</id>
    <name>habitacion principal</name>
    <description>Es una habitacion normal</description>
    <story>
      <page>Despiertas en una habitaci贸n, al fondo de la sala, ves una puerta.</page>
      <page>En el suelo, ves un cofre</page>
    </story>
    <directions>
      <direction>0</direction>
      <direction>-1</direction>
      <direction>-1</direction>
      <direction>-1</direction>
      <direction>-1</direction>
      <direction>-1</direction>
      <direction>-1</direction>
      <direction>-1</direction>
      <direction>-1</direction>
      <direction>-1</direction>
    </directions>
    <items>
      <itemId>0</itemId>
      <itemId>1</itemId>
      <itemId>2</itemId>
      <itemId>4</itemId>
    </items>
    <doors>
      <door>0</door>
      <door>-1</door>
      <door>-1</door>
      <door>-1</door>
      <door>-1</door>
      <door>-1</door>
      <door>-1</door>
      <door>-1</door>
      <door>-1</door>
      <door>-1</door>
    </doors>
    <endgameTrigger>false</endgameTrigger>
    <visited>false</visited>
  </room>
```

### Doors

Each Door in the game must be represented in an object. A Door has the following attributes. A Door Id can't be the same as an item id:

* **id**: Id who identifies the door. Must be unique and can't be repeated.

    <name>puerta de la habitaci贸n</name>
    <description>Puerta cerrada, parece que necesitas una llave para abrirla</description>
    <useMessage>Necesitas una llave para abrirla</useMessage>
    <open>false</open>
    <blocked>true</blocked>
    <keyId>0</keyId>
    <type>DOOR</type>
    <endgameTrigger>false</endgameTrigger>
  </Door>
```
### No Interactable Items

Items who have no use in game beside a message. An Item has the following attributes:

* **id**: Id who identifies the item. Must be unique and can't be repeated.
